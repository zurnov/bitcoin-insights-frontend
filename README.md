## üöÄ Deployment

The Bitcoin Insights application is deployed using Docker and involves multiple interconnected services. The server hosts the [BTC-I API](https://github.com/zurnov/bitcoin-insights). Here‚Äôs an overview of the deployment architecture:

    Bitcoin Core Service:
        Provides the core Bitcoin blockchain data and functionality.
        Directly interacts with the Bitcoin network and blockchain.

    ElectrumX Service:
        Acts as a caching layer for the Bitcoin blockchain data.
        Interfaces with the Bitcoin Core Service to retrieve and store blockchain data.

    Bitcoin Insights API:
        Serves as the backend for the Bitcoin Insights application.
        Fetches data from both the ElectrumX Service and Bitcoin Core Service.

    Bitcoin Insights Frontend:
        The Angular-based Single Page Application (SPA) that interacts with the Bitcoin Insights API to provide a rich user experience.

Data Flow:

    The frontend interacts with the Bitcoin Insights API, which fetches data from the ElectrumX and Bitcoin Core Services.
    ElectrumX caches and retrieves data from Bitcoin Core, which interacts with the Bitcoin network.

Deployment Details:

    The server setup includes Docker containers for each service, ensuring isolation and scalability.
    The deployment is optimized for performance and security to handle real-time data efficiently.
