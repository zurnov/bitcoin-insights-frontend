# COPILOT EDITS OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES
                
## PRIME DIRECTIVE
	Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
	Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
	Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE
	When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
		1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
            2. Your plan MUST include:
                   - All functions/sections that need modification
                   - The order in which changes should be applied
                   - Dependencies between changes
                   - Estimated number of separate edits required
                
            3. Format your plan as:
## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
	Working with: [filename]
	Total planned edits: [number]

### MAKING EDITS
	- Focus on one conceptual change at a time
	- Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
	- Include concise explanations of what changed and why
	- Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style

### Edit sequence:
	1. [First specific change] - Purpose: [why]
	2. [Second specific change] - Purpose: [why]
	3. Do you approve this plan? I'll proceed with Edit [number] after your confirmation.
	4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation before making ANY edits when user ok edit [number]
            
### EXECUTION PHASE
	- After each individual edit, clearly indicate progress:
		"✅ Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
	- If you discover additional needed changes during editing:
	- STOP and update the plan
	- Get approval before continuing
                
### REFACTORING GUIDANCE
	When refactoring large files:
	- Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
	- Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
	- Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
	- Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied
                
### RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE
	- For very large files, suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
	- Prioritize changes that are logically complete units
	- Always provide clear stopping points
            
## General Requirements
	Use modern technologies as described below for all code suggestions. Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments.
            
### Accessibility
	- Ensure compliance with **WCAG 2.1** AA level minimum, AAA whenever feasible.
	- Always suggest:
	- Labels for form fields.
	- Proper **ARIA** roles and attributes.
	- Adequate color contrast.
	- Alternative texts (`alt`, `aria-label`) for media elements.
	- Semantic HTML for clear structure.
	- Tools like **Lighthouse** for audits.
        
## Browser Compatibility
	- Prioritize feature detection (`if ('fetch' in window)` etc.).
        - Support latest two stable releases of major browsers:
	- Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari (macOS/iOS)
        - Emphasize progressive enhancement with polyfills or bundlers (e.g., **Babel**, **Vite**) as needed.
            
## PHP Requirements
	- **Target Version**: PHP 8.1 or higher
	- **Features to Use**:
	- Named arguments
	- Constructor property promotion
	- Union types and nullable types
	- Match expressions
	- Nullsafe operator (`?->`)
	- Attributes instead of annotations
	- Typed properties with appropriate type declarations
	- Return type declarations
	- Enumerations (`enum`)
	- Readonly properties
	- Emphasize strict property typing in all generated code.
	- **Coding Standards**:
	- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
	- Use strict typing with `declare(strict_types=1);`
	- Prefer composition over inheritance
	- Use dependency injection
	- **Static Analysis:**
	- Include PHPDoc blocks compatible with PHPStan or Psalm for static analysis
	- **Error Handling:**
	- Use exceptions consistently for error handling and avoid suppressing errors.
	- Provide meaningful, clear exception messages and proper exception types.
            
## HTML/CSS Requirements
	- **HTML**:
	- Use HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<search>`, etc.)
	- Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
	- Ensure valid markup that passes W3C validation
	- Use responsive design practices
	- Optimize images using modern formats (`WebP`, `AVIF`)
	- Include `loading="lazy"` on images where applicable
	- Generate `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for responsive images when relevant
	- Prioritize SEO-friendly elements (`<title>`, `<meta description>`, Open Graph tags)
            
	- **CSS**:
	- Use modern CSS features including:
	- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
	- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
	- CSS animations and transitions
	- Media queries for responsive design
	- Logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, etc.)
	- Modern selectors (`:is()`, `:where()`, `:has()`)
	- Follow BEM or similar methodology for class naming
	- Use CSS nesting where appropriate
	- Include dark mode support with `prefers-color-scheme`
	- Prioritize modern, performant fonts and variable fonts for smaller file sizes
	- Use modern units (`rem`, `vh`, `vw`) instead of traditional pixels (`px`) for better responsiveness
            
## JavaScript Requirements
		    
	- **Minimum Compatibility**: ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) or higher
	- **Features to Use**:
	- Arrow functions
	- Template literals
	- Destructuring assignment
	- Spread/rest operators
	- Async/await for asynchronous code
	- Classes with proper inheritance when OOP is needed
	- Object shorthand notation
	- Optional chaining (`?.`)
	- Nullish coalescing (`??`)
	- Dynamic imports
	- BigInt for large integers
	- `Promise.allSettled()`
	- `String.prototype.matchAll()`
	- `globalThis` object
	- Private class fields and methods
	- Export * as namespace syntax
	- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `flatMap`, etc.)
	- **Avoid**:
	- `var` keyword (use `const` and `let`)
	- jQuery or any external libraries
	- Callback-based asynchronous patterns when promises can be used
	- Internet Explorer compatibility
	- Legacy module formats (use ES modules)
	- Limit use of `eval()` due to security risks
	- **Performance Considerations:**
	- Recommend code splitting and dynamic imports for lazy loading
	**Error Handling**:
	- Use `try-catch` blocks **consistently** for asynchronous and API calls, and handle promise rejections explicitly.
	- Differentiate among:
	- **Network errors** (e.g., timeouts, server errors, rate-limiting)
	- **Functional/business logic errors** (logical missteps, invalid user input, validation failures)
	- **Runtime exceptions** (unexpected errors such as null references)
	- Provide **user-friendly** error messages (e.g., “Something went wrong. Please try again shortly.”) and log more technical details to dev/ops (e.g., via a logging service).
	- Consider a central error handler function or global event (e.g., `window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection')`) to consolidate reporting.
	- Carefully handle and validate JSON responses, incorrect HTTP status codes, etc.

## Documentation Requirements
	- Include JSDoc comments for JavaScript/TypeScript.
	- Document complex functions with clear examples.
	- Maintain concise Markdown documentation.
	- Minimum docblock info: `param`, `return`, `throws`, `author`

## Security Considerations
	- Sanitize all user inputs thoroughly.
	- Parameterize database queries.
	- Enforce strong Content Security Policies (CSP).
	- Use CSRF protection where applicable.
	- Ensure secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`).
	- Limit privileges and enforce role-based access control.
	- Implement detailed internal logging and monitoring.
